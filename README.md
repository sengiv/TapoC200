## Little ramble on the "why" of this project

Lets face it, this little C200 cam is quite popular.
The one I bought, even had a best seller sticker on it. (the real reason I bought it)<br>

I wouldn't say it is cheap, there are cheaper ones in Aliexpress. But it is definitely affordable.
At first boot, I must say I was impressed. Just seeing it move its head around was mesmerizing to watch.
To summarize it, I was more than satisfied with the hardware on this thing.
Then came the software part of the cam, disappoints started to creep in.<br>
A few things quickly become obvious as you set this puppy up. (things not mentioned in the manual)
1. Camera management is ONLY via an app on your phone.
2. Camera becomes unpredictably unresponsive the further it is from the WiFi router.
   You need RSSI 60dBi
3. NO ETHERNET PORT! I know it is 21st century and everything is "supposed to be" wireless, but nothing beats cable period!
   I saw posts by many having firmware update problems, and tplink's answer to them was to move camera closser to modem.
   Wait, what? Basically TpLink is saying that if you had 3 cams installed 20ft high around a 4000sqft warehouse and you want firware update
   you are screwed! Cable would have solved this problem & the bad streaming quality.

After a few more weeks of use, I had enough. Either I'm going to fix this or break it trying.
It is not a bad camera but it can be better!
